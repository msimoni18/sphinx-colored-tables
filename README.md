# sphinx-colored-tables

This extension enables options for coloring the cells of a column
based on the value in that cell.

## Limitations

This extension is currently only applied to the `.. csv-table::` directive
and has only been tested on cells with a single value in it.

This repo isn't set up as other sphinx extensions at the moment. To use,
copy the extensions folder into your personal project and update your
`conf.py`.
